SSDP-Discover
=============

What is it?
-----------

SSDP is a multicast-based protocol for discovering devices and services on the local network. It's also used by Universal Plug and Play (UPnP).

SSDP-Discover is a cross-platform .NET Core app that can be used to discover SSDP and UPnP devices and services.

How do I use it?
----------------

*TODO: installing dotnet runtime, etc.*

*TODO: native builds without dotnet runtime installed*

Executing the `ssdp-discover` app will automatically search for SSDP devices. You will then be prompted to select from a few choices, including viewing details of found devices, searching again, or quitting the app.
